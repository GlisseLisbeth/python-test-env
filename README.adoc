# Python Testing Environment

This is a simple environment for testing out
_Python_ scripts. Ideally for studing algorithms and data structures.

## Requirements

- https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile[Make]

## Available Tools

- https://github.com/docker-library/python/tree/master/3.8[Python 3.8]
- https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html[pytest]
- https://github.com/psf/black[black]
- https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/[typing-extensions]

## Usage

### Makefile

All the commands are inside this file. You can modify
`IMAGE` and `RUN` variables to suit your needs.

### `$ make build`

This command will create the `container`.

### `$ make format`

This command will execute _Black_ code formatter.

### `$ make run`

This command will execute _Python_ REPL inside the container.

### `$ make shell`

This command will enter the _Bash_ shell inside the container.

### `$ make test`

This command will execute _Pytest_ inside the container.

### _Taskfile.sh_

`Taskfile.sh` is a special file that helps running commands inside the container. To execute it first use `$ make shell` to enter the container. Then you can use `run` to execute commands defined in `Taskfile.sh`.

#### `$ run test`

Runs _Pytest_.

#### `$ run test:file <file>`

Runs _Pytest_ on a file named `test/test_<file>.py`

#### `$ run test:file:fn <file> "<keywords>"`

Runs _Pytest_ on a file named `test/test_<file>.py` and execute all the methods wich contains the words inside "<keywords>".
